The script uses pandoc and asciidoctor to generate pdfs.   \r\nYou don't need to have either installed locally - the script runs them from docker containers.\r\n\r\nIt will produce printable pdfs with lists where you can tick each item once it's done.\r\n\r\nPull requests with updated lists or script improvements are encouraged and very welcome.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
