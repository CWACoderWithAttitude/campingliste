# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
# As suggested here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57549439/how-do-i-use-docker-with-github-actions
name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

        - name: change workdir
        run: cd $HOME/work/campingliste/campingliste

        - name: Run converter
        run: ./convert.sh
      #- name: misc md2asciidoc
      #  uses: docker://pandoc/latex:2.6 #misc.md --to=asciidoc -o mis.asciidoc
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    #- uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    #- name: Run a one-line script
    #  run: echo Hello, world!

    # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
    #- name: Run a multi-line script
    #  run: |
    #    echo Add other actions to build,
    #    echo test, and deploy your project.
